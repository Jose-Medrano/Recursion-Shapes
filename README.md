Circle8B
  Circle8B is a class that creates circles with more encompassing circles as a
  possibility if that is what is wanted. Each encompassing circle having a
  shorter radius than the one beforehand. The circles could be full, or just
  outlines as well. Each circle having its own random color.

Square
  This class is a class that creates squares and if wanted can create a grid
  made up of many squares. Both the grid and normal squares can be solid or have
  outlines. Each square having its own random color.

Triangle
  This class is a class that creates squares and if wanted to can create a
  triforce (triangles using the midpoints of the previous triangle to create a
  new triangle). The triangles can be solid or an outline and each triangle has
  its own random color.

Fibonacci
  This class creates an image based on the Golden Ratio. The image is a spiral
  that gets wider and wider the longer it goes on. The size is designed by using
  the fibonacci sequence.

Exercise
  This class was a practice class to get the students ready for recursion which
  is the idea of a method calling itself until it gets a job done.

Short Response
  1.) The basic idea of recursion is that we want the method to keep looping
      itself around until we get our desired output. It's more beneficial then a
      code with loops because it has shorter amount of code and therefore less
      prone to errors. A base case is a condition that tells the method that we
      no longer want it to keep looping.

  2.) Recursion is when we have a method making constant calls to itself until a
      specific condition is met and iteration is having a loop within the body
      of a method that stops when there is a condition met such as a for loop.
      Iterations could be more straightforward and simple to write, however it
      involves writing a lot more, therefore it is more prone to errors. Using
      recursion could be extra useful if the recursion process becomes cleaner
      with each loop.

  3.) All the special cases were interesting to code because we needed to use
      recursion. Trying to understand the basic format for the recursion process
      was complexed but once i understand the basic layout and logic then it
      became a lot easier for the rest of the shapes, excluding fibonacci. The
      basic idea was determining when and why would we recall the same method
      and if we do, how much and what do we change?

  4.) Compile errors were mostly non-existent. In fact the most difficult thing
      about the PSA was just understanding how recursion works and how to
      implement that. So i had to be extra careful when writing my code thus
      eliminating most compile errors before they started. The most complicated
      and most difficult to solve has to be the Fibonacci sequence class because
      of how confusing its recursion method is.
